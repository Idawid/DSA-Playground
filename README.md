## Patterns:
### Array (or strings):
#### Two pointers
Usually left & right, or left1 & left2 but different speeds.  

What for:  
- String reversal  
- Sorted array re-sorting.  
#### Sliding window
Pair of pointers marking a window. The window is being dragged accross the array. 

What for:  
- Any subarray problem: sum, average or the biggest size.
#### Prefix sum  
Alias: cumulative/ running sum. Stored in single var or array (all).

What for:
- you do + / -... on each array element

#### Related to the data structure: 
1. Binary search.
2. Sorting.
### Hashing:

### Linked lists:

### Stack / Queue:

### Trees: 
#### Binary search:
